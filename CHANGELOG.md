## [1.1.0-beta] - 2025-10-02

### Added
- **Handshake Verification System**: Peers now verify encryption key compatibility before establishing connection
- **Key Hash Generation**: SHA-256 hash of encryption keys for secure verification without exposing the key
- **Password Mismatch Detection**: System detects and alerts users when someone tries to join with incorrect password

- **Decryption Logic**: Failed decryptions no longer display "[DECRYPTION FAILED]" messages to users

### Fixed
